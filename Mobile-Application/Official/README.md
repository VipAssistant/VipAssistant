## Official Mobile Application 
Our Main Mobile Application codebase, will be initiated with the implementations of Demo version on WP-5 (later) 

### Main Git Flow (same as the Demo)
`master`: Implementations will not be merged to `master` until we have a fully-functional mobile platform.

`development`: Main development branch that we are going accumulate our tested and done implementations, each group member will develop his work on a seperate branch on top of this branch. Finished correct implementations will be merged to development again.
