## Demo Mobile Application 
Will be used for the development and testing purposes of our modules in WP-3 and WP-4 (Planned Module-to-developed list is given below). This demo application is planned to be in our scope of development during rest of the fall semester since WP-3 and WP-4 approximately covers that much duration. On WP-5 we plan to merge, refactor and extend this Demo Mobile Application with our Official Mobile Application. 

Also we wish to use this demo in our Midterm Presentation date, hence we plan to finish a prototype (that has some modules implemented from WP-4) until Midterm Presentation date.

### Main Git Flow
`master`: Implementations will not be merged to `master` until we have a fully-functional demo-ready platform.

`development`: Main development branch that we are going accumulate our tested and done implementations on Demo mobile platform, each group member will develop his work on a seperate branch on top of this branch. Finished correct implementations on demo application will be merged to development again.

### Planned Modules to be Developed & Tested in Scope of Demo Mobile Application

* A prototype mobile platform that can be presented at Midterm Presentation and has some of the modules below implemented  

#### WP-4
