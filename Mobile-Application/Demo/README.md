## Demo Mobile Application 
Will be used for the development of Demo Mobile Application that we are going to build until Midterm Presentation date.

### Git Flow
`master`: Implementations will not be merged to `master` until we have a fully-functional demo-ready platform.
`development`: Main development branch that we are going accumulate our tested and done implementations on Demo mobile platform, each group member will develop his work on a seperate branch on top of this branch. Finished implementations on demo application will be merged to development again.
